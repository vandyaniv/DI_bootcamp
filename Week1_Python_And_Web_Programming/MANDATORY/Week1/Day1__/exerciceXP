print("""Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world""") 


#ok so here we just ask the the terminal five time " hello word "

# exercice 2 Calcul with python 

#Write code that calculates the result of: (99^3)*8 (meaning 99 to the power of 3, times 8).c
#  
calcul = 99 ** 3
print(calcul*8)

 
 # so here i declare a variable with the name of calcul because i calculate the value of is the calcul i request the terminal to send back the value )
  
  #Exercise 3 : What is the output ?
#Predict the output of the following code snippets:
    #  here we have 
    
result1 = 5 < 3
print(f"5 < 3 : {result1}")

result2 = 3 == 3
print(f"3 == 3 : {result2}")

result3 =  3 == "3"
print(f'3 == "3" : {result3}')

result4 = "Hello" == "hello"
print(f' "Hello" == "hello" {result4}')


# new exercice 
#1Create a variable called computer_brand which value is the brand name of your computer.
#2 Using the computer_brand variable print a sentence that states the following: "I have a <computer_brand> computer".

# ok so here my variable should send a message on the terminal



computer_brand = 'dell'
print(f"i have a {computer_brand} computer")

# exercice 5 
# here the key to understand is that we want a print that will send text + variable + text 

name = "Yaniv"

age = 31

shoe_size = 43

info = "motivated"
print(f"Hey, I'm {name}, I'm {age} years old, my shoe size is {shoe_size}.")

#Exercise 6 : A & B
# so if A bigger than B in that case print text 

A = 6 
B = 3
if A > B: print("Hello Wordl")

#Exercise 7 : Odd or Even
#so here the explanation not easy but like this 
#how variable as a number the number is question A is even = text+ever 
#and "if not "  the text + is odd

number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:  
 # here if the number is even then print the message 
  print(f'The number {number} is even')
else: 
     print(f'The number {number} is odd')  
     
     
#exercice 8
user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")
if user_name != "Yaniv":
    print("you have a cute name")

# exercice 9 tall enough 
height = int(input("Please enter your height in cm: "))

if height > 145:
    print("You must be taller to ride")
